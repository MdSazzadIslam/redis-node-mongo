Redis is an open-source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker.
Redis is best in situations that require data to be retrieved and delivered to the client in the least amount of time.

One of the most popular use cases of Redis is caching. Caching is the process of storing copies of data in caches to allow applications to access and retrieve data faster. As a developer our task is to complete the client request as fast as possible.
